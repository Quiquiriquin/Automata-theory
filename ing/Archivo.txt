Hi, this text is for test our program. Our program is able to identify the words with ing ending. That's the reason that we ara going to use a lot of words with ing. The next month we are going to go to Puebla. The teacher said that in the museum still have old computers. Yeah, computers that used a full room. So I think that it will be very interesting. Ok, I'm no using a lot of ing words, so I need to use more. Thinking about the trip I remember that I'm going to have my final english exam at CENLEX the same day of the trip. I don't know what to do. I'm annying because I don't know any way to do before my exam. Well, maybe the text be useful for the program. I'm looking forward to test it. I'm going to add some words with ing. Looking, feeling, getting, proving, testing, walking, running.
